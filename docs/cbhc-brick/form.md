If for whatever reason you are unable to source a raspberry pi pico, please [fill out this form](https://forms.gle/6KhpHQFXQvcQVj9J7).

On a case-by-case basis, we may be able to help you get access to a pico for the purposes of unbricking your console. We ask that if this is useful to you, that you may be able to "pay it forward" by passing it onto someone else with the issue, if you can.
