## Possible issue: Dead NAND
Certain revisions of the Wii U are using "Hynix" brand system memory. These have been observed to be unreliable and may start to "die".

Check your serial number against the list of consoles that have been submitted at the [Wii U System Database](https://wiiu.gerbilsoft.com), to see if it's likely you have a Hynix one.

If you do, there is a hardmod that can replace your system NAND with an SD card. You may be able to get a local electronics store to assist you in installing this, or watch some tutorials on how to do it on your own.

Information about the modchip by [Voultar is available here](https://twitter.com/Voultar/status/1646245011564945411).

## Possible issue: Corrupt NAND
A corrupt NAND can be fixed using [UDPIH](https://github.com/GaryOderNichts/udpih) and the [recovery_menu](https://github.com/GaryOderNichts/recovery_menu) if you have a NAND backup. This has to have had been made in advanced using homebrew software, otherwise it is not an option.

With no backup, in the future, you will be able to use [shinyquagsire's de_Fuse](https://douevenknow.us/post/714056575412764672/defuse-the-one-true-pwn), and a hard mod, to fix your console! As of the time of writing, this is not yet an option.
